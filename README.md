# lgrep

`lgrep` is a `grep`-like utility which better understands log files. Log records in log files often correspond to lines
of text, but not always. Since `grep` only understands lines of text, this can require some gymnastics to extract full
log records. To make it concrete, this snippet of log file contains 11 lines of text, but only four log records (of
one, eight, one, and one lines).

If we're `grep`ing for errors, we might try this:

```
% grep -i error app.log
2024-07-01 01:25:47.755 Unexpected error occurred in scheduled task
2024-07-01 01:25:47.790 queue draining complete (ERROR)
```

Hmm... Right records, but not very helpful. How about `-A`:

```
% grep -i -A 5 error app.log
2024-07-01 01:25:47.755 Unexpected error occurred in scheduled task

```

This time we got part of the stack trace, but also the unrelated message at the end (and a `--`). What we want is
exactly the matching log records, each one in its entirety, and nothing else. That's `lgrep`:

```
% lgrep -i error app.log

The trick is that log records are clearly identifiable by "starts with a timestamp". `lgrep` uses this to build up a
full log record and then check if it matches the pattern. If it does, print out the whole record.

## Options

`lgrep` supports a number of options that `grep` supports, such as `-v` and `-i`. It also supports a few new ones, such
as `--start` to skip lines in a file until some pattern matches. Use `-h` for a summary, or `--help` for gory detail.

## Log Format

If your log records don't start with a timestamp, use `--log-pattern` to override the default "start of record" pattern.
Each line of the input which matches the pattern starts a new record. If you want `lgrep` to behave like `grep`, pass
`--log-pattern=` to match every line, and therefore equate records with lines. If your application consistently formats
its logs (🤞), the `LGREP_LOG_PATTERN` environment variable can be used instead of supplying `--log-pattern` all over
the place. The option still takes precedence, for ad hoc use.
